An explanation of how the code works and run:

This script is checking the words in a text file, "AliceInWonderland200.txt" against a dictionary list of words in a separate text file, 
"dictionary.txt", and printing out any words that are not found in the dictionary. 

It does so by first importing the regular expression module and defining a function split_line that uses regular expressions to extract words from a line. 
Then it initializes empty lists for the dictionary and 'Alice in Wonderland' words, opens the dictionary file, 
reads each line, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, 
adds the words from the line to the dictionary list, 
removes duplicates, and sorts the list alphabetically. 

After that, the script opens the text file, "AliceInWonderland200.txt" and reads it line by line, 
stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of words, and iterates over each word in the line. 
The script then checks if the word is not in the dictionary list and if it is not, 
it prints the line number and the word that was not found in the dictionary and breaks out of the loop. 

The script starts by performing a linear search, where it reads the "AliceInWonderland200.txt" file line by line, 
splits each line into a list of words and iterates over each word. Then it checks if the word is in the dictionary list using the in keyword.
After that, it repeats the same process using a binary search algorithm to check if the word is in the dictionary list 
and prints the same message if the word is not found.

** Both searches, binary and linear, do the same thing, except binary is more efficient and potentially faster. **
